EasyPermGals automatically appends a gallery of all images to a post or **Page**

== Description ==

EasyPermGals 1.3 is based on [EasyGals](http://www.waltervos.com/downloads/wordpress-plugins/easygals/ "EasyGals") by Walter Vos. Where easygals allows you to manually activate the automatic gallery feature on a **per-post/per-Page** basis, EasyPermGals does this automatically. Each and every **post** or **Page** is checked for attached images which are then displayed in a neat gallery underneath.
Lightbox, if installed, may be used to view the full-size images.

After a feature request, I added the option to switch between manual and automatic thumbnail attachment. This allows you to define, exactly **where** the thumbnails are supposed to be embedded.

== Installation ==

Installation is simple:

1. Download EasyPermGals
1. Unzip
1. upload easypermgals.php to yoursite/wp-content/plugins directory
1. activate
1. customize (optional)

In Full-Auto mode, EasyPermGals appends all thumbnails to the end of the post, unless it finds the [easypermgals] tag, which is then used for positioning.
In manual mode, use [easypermgals] to insert the gallery in your post or Page.


== Screenshots ==

1. The options screen.
2. The output. A bunch of thumbnails. Simple yet powerful.
